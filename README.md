# Condo Manager

This project was originally conceived during the modeling classes of my postgraduate program in Agile Software Development. It was later transformed into this repository to implement the modeled system while exploring new technologies and deepening my understanding of those I was already studying.

## Project Goals

This project is focused on:

- Practicing domain modeling using UML
- Exploring the use of the chosen technologies in a real-world context
- Practice writing raw SQL queriers to gain better database control
- Learning a new frontend framework (Svelte)

## Features

- Register and manage apartments
- Register residents and assign them to apartments
- Record and monitor payments
- Track maintenance requests
- Create parking spaces and vehicle registration

## Documentation

It's possible to see the documentation for the project in the /docs folder. They consist of the base UML diagrams modeled in the classes of my postgraduate program, along with any additional documentation added through the development.

The diagrams were made using Astah UML and the wireframes using Figma.

The diagrams are in PT-BR and it's planned to translate them to english.

## Stack

This project is written as a full-stack web application. It aims to explore new technologies and deepen existing knowledge. Below is a table of the used technologies.

| Technology       | Application                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Astah UML        | UML diagrams                 |
| Figma            | Wireframes                   |
| Go               | Backend programming language |
| Gin              | Web framework for the API    |
| PostgreSQL       | Database management          |
| Svelte (planned) | Frontend framework           |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Translate UML diagrams to english
- [ ] Develop the backend of the application following the documentation specifications
- [ ] Develop the frontend of the application following the documentation specifications
